# Face Similarity using Deep Learning
## This a project that discovers different techniques for measuring face similarity.
## The dataset used is the Totally Looks Like dataset that is designed for visual similarity that was cleaned and prepared to be exclusive for facial similarity.
## We started by comparing the results with the dataset but then we combined both folders and tried sorting the faces to conceive some pairs thar are more similar.
## Fun task you can also find your look a like from the dataset using the looklike notebook in the notebook folder.
